/**
Input
The first line will contain a single integer n: the number of trees in the specified section of the
forest.
The next line will contain n integers, indicating the age of each tree in years from the starting
point. Each age will be separated by a single space.
0 <= n < 20
0 <= age < 7

Output
The first line of the output should print the total number of growth buds in the section of the
forest.
The remaining output should display a diagram of each tree in the forest, following the
specification seen below. Dashes are used below for clarityâ€”each dash should be replaced with
a space.
